This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of mobile app reviews to uncover meaningful insights from user feedback. The dataset contains details such as the app name, user reviews, sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral), numerical ratings ranging from 1 to 5, and the date of each review. By analyzing this data, the project aims to highlight user preferences, pain points, and general trends that can guide app developers toward improving their products.

The analysis begins with data cleaning, which includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting the dataset for consistency. Once prepared, descriptive statistics are used to understand the overall distribution of ratings and sentiments. Visualizations play a key role in this process, showcasing the spread of ratings, the proportion of positive versus negative reviews, common keywords within user feedback, and review patterns over time. Sentiment analysis techniques are also applied to text data, providing a clearer view of user satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

The notebook makes use of Python and several popular libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, NLTK or TextBlob for sentiment analysis, and WordCloud for generating text-based visual insights. Together, these tools allow for a thorough exploration of the dataset in an interactive manner.

To run the project, users can simply clone the repository, open the Jupyter Notebook, and execute the code within mobile_app_reviews_Data_set_EDA.ipynb. The findings reveal interesting insights, such as the strong correlation between higher ratings and positive sentiments, the frequent mention of bugs and crashes in negative reviews, and the tendency for positive reviews to highlight usability and features. Additionally, time-series analysis shows seasonal spikes in user reviews, often aligning with app updates or new releases.

This analysis not only provides an in-depth look at user feedback but also demonstrates how EDA can be applied in real-world scenarios to better understand consumer behavior.
