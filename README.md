This project explores the patterns of screen time usage among students by analyzing a dedicated dataset that records their daily digital activity. The dataset contains information such as the amount of time spent on devices, categories of usage, and overall screen exposure patterns. The goal of this analysis is to understand how students allocate their time across different digital platforms, identify potential overuse, and highlight patterns that may affect productivity, learning, and well-being.

The notebook begins with data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and consistency, followed by descriptive statistics to summarize overall trends. Visualizations are then used to uncover insights, such as the distribution of average screen time, comparisons between groups of students, and variations in usage across different days or categories of activity. By combining numerical summaries with charts, the analysis provides a clear view of how digital habits vary within the student community.

The project uses Python along with data science libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and other analytical tools for in-depth exploration. The results reveal key insights, including the average number of hours students spend on screens, common patterns of usage during weekdays versus weekends, and potential outliers who exhibit unusually high screen time. These findings can be useful for educators, parents, and policymakers who are concerned about the impact of screen time on academic performance, mental health, and lifestyle.

By making the dataset and analysis publicly available, this project serves as an example of how exploratory data analysis can be applied to real-world problems, offering data-driven insights into one of the most discussed aspects of modern student life.
